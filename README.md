<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This code demonstrates the use of the useContext hook in React to pass data through a component tree.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul>
<li>
The MyContext object is created using the React.createContext() method. This object can then be passed as a value to the MyContext.Provider component, which is used to wrap the components that need to access the context data.
</li>
<li>
In the App component, a value of { message: "Hello World!" } is passed as the value to the MyContext.Provider component, and the HelloWorld component is rendered within it.
</li>
<li>
In the HelloWorld component, the useContext hook is used to access the value from MyContext and assign it to the context variable. The component then renders a card with the message "Hello World!" and a description of how it is being rendered using the useContext hook.
</li>
<li>
The App component is exported as the default export, making it the starting point for the application.
</li>
</ul>
